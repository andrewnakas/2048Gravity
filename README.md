2048Gravity
===========

2048 Gravity is an open source project that is a variant of 
https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048 built in unity3d that uses
mobile's acclerameter to control gravity and slide the tiles. 

Some things that i want to add to this game. 

Add social game center elements to ios


Object pooling


Fix odd number of tiles instantiating the bigger peice in the odd tiles spot.


I am building an intigrated digital marketing experecince for this game over the next couple weeks as part one of my classes. 
It's going to be as open source as possible and hopefully you can learn some techniques for indie game marketing from it.
It's going to be a wild ride.
